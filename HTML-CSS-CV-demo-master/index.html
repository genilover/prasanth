          <h4>ACCIDENT PREVENTION SYSTEM USING ULTRASONIC SENSOR</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="descrition">
          <p> The main objective of the develop system is to avoid accident by giving indication through lamp or buzzer.
            Accidents can occur anywhere, anytime therefore it is necessary to develop a system to avoid accidents. Now-a-days
            accidents are happening more frequently due to globalization, lack of attention, drowsiness, fast speed of vehicles. On
            the curved road vehicles of one side cannot predict that vehicles are coming from other side due to this accidents can
            happen. To overcome this problem the system has been developed in a simple manner using microcontroller, ultrasonic
            sensors. This proposed system gives indication of vehicles coming from opposite side by using two lamps on both sides
            of road. This system plays an important role in avoiding the road accidents. </p>

          <h4>FOOD QUALITY MONITORING SYSTEM USING ARDUINO</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="descrition">
          <p>Food safety and hygiene is a major concern in order to prevent the food wastage. The Quality of the food needs to be monitored and it must be prevented from rotting and decaying by the atmospheric factors like temperature, humidity and dark. Therefore, it is useful to deploy quality monitoring devices at food stores. These quality monitoring devices keep a watch on the environmental factor that cause or pace up decay of the food. Later, the environmental factors can be controlled like by refrigeration, vacuum storage etc..</p>
